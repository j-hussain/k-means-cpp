# Implementing K-Means Clustering from Scratch

A lot of people implement algorithms from scratch to consolidate their understanding of its fundamentals. For me, this was more of an ode in some sense; K-Means was the first machine learning algorithm I fully understand, both conceptually and in action, so it felt fair to redevelop it from scratch. Why C++? I come from a primarily Python background ~~literally only Python for my own projects~~ and understood the necessity to branch outwards. C++ was a language I always tried but never fully grasped growing up, but now, as a first year university student, I appreciate it for its uses.
