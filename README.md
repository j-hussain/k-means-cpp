# Implementing K-Means Clustering from Scratch

A lot of people implement algorithms from scratch to consolidate their understanding of its fundamentals. For me, this was more of an ode in some sense; K-Means was the first machine learning algorithm I fully understand, both conceptually and in action, so it felt fair to redevelop it from scratch. Why C++? I come from a primarily Python background ~~literally only Python for my own projects~~ and understood the necessity to branch outwards. C++ was a language I always tried but never fully grasped growing up, but now, as a first year university student, I am loving it more and more, so what better language to pick than one I'm newly learning!

In terms of the future of my GitHub, I hope to see a lot more C++, C# and Golang, and this is the start of it!
